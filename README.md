After going through the Web Development 101 track, I've learned the basics of GIT, HTML and CSS, along with web development tools on Firefox. I started way back when the HTML and CSS introductions were done via the codecademy free lessons, but finished with FreeCodeCamp.org lessons.

Tried doing the FCC projects. "Successfully" finished (read: copiet) the first one. The gist is - that is not a good way to teach a subject, be it coding or anything else. Head First book series has a really good grasp at what it takes to actually truly and deeply learn and remember something. Shame their HTML/CSS book is so old.

In short, the tutorials had no meaning besides playing with some random code on a web page. I just read and followed instructions. I was not challenged to think or solve problems. Only after going through all the lessons did they present the 'projects'. I had already forgotten most of what I had gone through. If I am not mistaken, the very fist project required solutions that were not taught in the lessons.

Perhaps I should have gone with a good HTML/CSS book or tutorial like the HTMLdog?

Anyhow, let's try the Odin Project HTML/CSS project and see what I can do on my own. :)
